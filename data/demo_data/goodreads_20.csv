 This is definitely one of my favorites among the ""food books"" I've read! I loved the characters (Raggedy Ann and Ken Carson included)! Even though Kayla is a pessimist (which I usually dislike in a character), her personality is the perfect formula in the story. 
 Kayla is the school rebel, she wears unusual clothes, makes fun of the ""popular"" crowd in school, and she only have one friend in school---Nicole. Lately, things have been changing around her. Her mother barely talks to her and her best friend is dating her long-time crush Ben! On her disastrous 16th birthday party, she made a wish to make all her birthday wishes come true. The following day she wakes up with a pink pony on her backyard! The next day it was a room full of gumballs, and the next her Raggedy doll Ann was brought to life! She figured out that her birthday wishes are coming true and she have to find a way to stop it before her 15th birthday wish comes true---which is a kiss from Ben! 
 I really had fun reading it. It reminded me a lot of my childhood and my silly wishes. I might have wished for a one year supply of chocolates or a new BMX bike before, LOL! Also, there are a lot hilarious events that occurred in the story. My favorite is definitely Ken's dancing pecs! haha! The story ended abruptly though. I wish we found out what happened to Ann, Ken, the pony and the rest of her wishes...instead of Kayla waking up the following day with them gone. 
 Overall it was a quick read. If you are looking for something light and fun, this is perfect for you!",Sat Nov 10 06:06:13 -0800 2012,Sun Nov 11 05:38:36 -0800 2012,Sun Nov 11 05:38:36 -0800 2012,Sat Nov 10 00:00:00 -0800 2012,1,0,1

 ""You are what you drink."" 
 I'm a huge fan of coffee but I don't buy my coffee in Starbucks or other coffee shops because I find it expensive. If you drink too much coffee like I do, it's economical to make it myself. LOL. So, I'm not very familiar with the kind of coffee and lattes being mentioned in the book. However, I find Jane's match making skills amusing. It sound unreal but interesting nonetheless. 
 Jane Turner is a teenage employee of Wired Joe's coffee shop. She's been working as a barista for a while now that she can predict a customer's order just by looking at them. She keeps a notebook where she writes her observations. One day, one of her favorite regulars broke up with his girlfriend and Jane got an idea to set him up with her co-worker's friend. She finds the two suitable for each other because of their usual coffee orders and their personalities. To make the story short, her boss found out about her unusual hobby and used it as a promotion for their shop which became very successful. 
 Jane is an unusual character, she's been skipping school and stopped going to the community college for her college credits because she find school ""boring"", but she wants to get in to a fashion school...totally unrelated to coffee (and matchmaking) business right? Anyway, what I didn't like about her character is her un-professionalism at work. She gives away free drinks to cute guys (Will and his friends) and she power trips (sending her co-worker to do bathroom duties for a month because she ratted her out for giving away free coffees). That was totally uncool. Being an assistant manager doesn't allow you to do such thing to your co-workers, it only shows that she's not the best person for the position. Jane is a great friend though, she consoled her broken hearted best friend Em and quickly tried to apologize when her matchmaking plan backfired on them. 
 This is a fun and cute read. Perfect for YA Chick Lit readers and coffee lovers.",Fri Nov 09 21:55:16 -0800 2012,Sat Nov 10 05:41:49 -0800 2012,Sat Nov 10 05:41:49 -0800 2012,Fri Nov 09 00:00:00 -0800 2012,1,0,0

 If you feel like travelling to Europe and you don't have the money for it, read this book and you'll experience the beauty and madness of Europe! 
 When I read Aunt Peg's first envelope, I thought this is just a simple adventure she made up for Ginny. I thought she just want Ginny to loosen up a bit and try to have fun. However, as I continue reading her little blue envelopes, I realized that Aunt Peg want Ginny to get something more than just fun on her Europe escapade. Sometimes I find Aunt Peg's instructions crazy and unsafe...not bringing a cellphone for example, how can you call for help in case of emergency? And that one where she instructed Ginny to ask a guy out in Rome---she almost got raped by that guy! 
 Anyway, I find Ginny's character admirable. You can see how much she loved and trusted her Aunt that she followed all the instructions in the letters and left the US with only $1000 in her pocket. I would never go anywhere without my phone or laptop! 
 I wasn't very satisfied with how things ended in this book. I was disappointed when Ginny lost the 13th envelope. Sure we learned that Aunt Peg married Richard, they sold her expensive art, etc.. however, we never knew what her final words were. =( I wasn't crazy about the Keith and Ginny ""romance"" either.

 I read and enjoyed the first two novels from this series and I have to say that in this book I miss the ""sporty"" part of this supposedly sports contemporary novel. Anyhow, I still liked it and there were a lot of lessons pertaining to faith and religious belief. I have nothing against Christian novels, I read them occasionally and enjoy them most of the time. On this particular novel though, you have to understand that the heroine is a teenager and is in a process of finding herself. You have to be patient with Kate and keep an open mind as you read a long because she's a little confused. She's also re-evaluating her choices and decisions made in the past few months. 
 Kate was raised in a Christian family and have been a regular church attendee of Forrest Sanctuary all her life. (Note: In Stealing Parker, Parker used to go to the same church as Kate's and was shunned by the said church members after her mom's ""scandal""). Anyway, Kate have been carrying a guilt for assisting her best friend to go through abortion. She felt like she and her bestfriend needed saving and tried to involve Emily to find forgiveness through prayers. However, Emily had a change of heart since her abortion. She no longer share the same faith as Kate's thus their misunderstanding. When Emily's family found out about the abortion, she was kicked out of her house and had to work to support herself. She's supposed to go to a summer camp as a councilor with Kate, but due to her current situation, Kate had to go alone. There she reunites with Matt, the first and only guy she kissed. 
 Kate's character wasn't very easy to like. She's uptight and judgmental. However, I understand where she's coming from. She is what she is because of her upbringing. She's a good kid and she just followed what her parents and her church says. Matt on the other hand is a laid-back college student. Even though he's a Christian, he joined a fraternity, drinks beer occasionally and hangs out with non-Christian kids. He's sweet and kind though. Despite their differences, they were attracted to each other. Most of the time, Kate's actions and thoughts were annoying but I'm glad she learned a few things in the end. She became open-minded about other people's belief and learned to respect them. 
 I think the main lesson in this book is for us to understand that religions and churches are not perfect. I'm a Roman Catholic and I have friends who are from different religious groups (INC, Mormons, Baptists, Born Again, Muslims, etc) and I never had a hard time talking about religion with them. In fact i'm fascinated with the similarities with the religions. Respect and open-mindedness is very important when you deal with people who have different values and religious beliefs, otherwise, you'll have problems like Kate had. 
 Anyway, this was a good read. I only recommend this book to YA readers who don't have issues in reading books about religion.",Thu Oct 18 00:57:00 -0700 2012,Mon Apr 01 23:00:51 -0700 2013,Sat Mar 30 00:00:00 -0700 2013,Fri Mar 29 00:00:00 -0700 2013,0,0,0

He left when her sister died in a car accident and never called back when she informed him about her mother's cancer. There is no love lost between them, but he is the only family she have left. Her mother died just a few weeks ago and she have to sell their house to cover her mother's medical bills. With only 20 dollars left on her pocket she drove from Alabama to Florida to live with her dad and his new family. Unfortunately, when she reached Rosemary Beach, she learned that her dad is away on a trip with his wife. With no money, no gas, and an empty stomach, Blaire was ready to fall apart. However, when her silver-eyed stepbrother offered her a place to stay, she immediately accepted. Rush was rude, insensitive, and a certified player... but, he's also sexy as hell! How long can Blaire ignore her attraction to her step brother? She's innocent, he's worldly, she's poor, he's insanely rich. He is definitely out of her league, but are those reasons enough to stay away from him? 
 ""I didn't fit in with them. I'd never fit in at my high school either. My life was just one big awkward moment."" 
 - Blaire 
 This book started so well, Blaire came to Rosemary Beach packing a 9mm gun. I was like woah, this girl is a bad ass! Also, Blaire have been through a lot--her twin sister died in a car accident, her father left them, and the most recent one is her mother's death from cancer. Blaire is independent and works hard to support herself. With that in mind, I was expecting her to be different. I thought she can handle herself around Rush and give the guy a hard time chasing her, but no! Just one look at Rush and poof, the fierce Blaire was gone. Despite that, her character isn't that bad. She's a good girl and a hard worker. I also liked her friendship with Bethy and Jimmy. 
 ""I know my actions don't appear to back that up but if you'd just let me explain. God, baby, I can't stand seeing you in so much pain."" 
 - Rush 
 Rush is an intriguing character. I liked him in the beginning because he's hot! However, as I read along, I realized that he doesn't have any other admirable characteristics. Sure he was a great brother (to Nan at least) and he's protective of Blaire, but I don't know... it felt like he's not showing his feelings correctly, probably his secret is affecting his behavior. 
 Anyway, there's one character I really loved in this book--- Woods! Even though Blaire didn't even try to get to know the guy, Woods was nice and decent. He's always looking out for her and helps her whenever he can. I think he's the only guy who have an actual job in this book! LOL. I'm looking forward to read his story! 
 This is a fast-paced, hot and addictive read. Highly recommended to New Adult Fiction readers. 
 PS. Thanks to my GR friends who informed me about the cliff hanger ending! =D 
 PPS. I'm reserving my comments about Nan for my review of Book 2.

 WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! 
 I've been waiting for this book to come out since last year. I loved the first two books in this series even though the second book ended with Emma leaving Evan. I wasn't able to read Out of Breath as soon as it came out because I joined a reading challenge and I actually have to follow a reading list. So, when I finally got around reading it, there are a lot of reviews in GR already and being a natural curious, I read them. Unfortunately, the reviews are not what I was expecting. A lot were disappointed, and even though it pains me to say this: I agree with them. 
 The book is written in 2 POV's- Emma and Evan's, but majority of the chapters were written in Emma's POV (Chapters 1-14 are all written in Emma's POV). Okay, here it goes: It was bad. Not the writing style, but the story. It was painful to see Emma like that. She's self-destructive. I think I liked the Emma before despite the abuse and battery she experienced because I can offer sympathy to those kind of characters. It wasn't their choice to be in that situation in the first place. However,in this book, Emma was almost always drunk, she makes out with guys she doesn't know, and does other impulsive stuff. She's really in a bad place and I can't stomach what she's doing to herself. And then she met Cole. I didn't like Cole, but I didn't hate him either. He seems like a nice guy, but I like Evan too much that I couldn't make myself to like him. He was patient with Emma, and he somehow helps her forget her issues. They slept together, a LOT, but get this, THEY ARE NOT DATING. I pretty much skimmed ALL the parts whenever Emma uses Cole as her distraction or as her anesthetic, and by that, I meant them having sex. I'm just so mad at Emma at this point, I almost gave up reading the book and then FINALLY Evan showed up on Emma's mom's funeral. 
 Honestly, Evan is the only reason why I continued reading this book. I was very curious about what happened to him after Emma left. It wasn't revealed in an instant but there were hints that he was really messed up when Emma left. (grrr Emma!) I didn't like his decision to spend the summer in California because it's obvious that he's not over Emma. Plus, Cole and Emma are together even though she says they are NOT DATING. I also think his 2 week deal with Emma was really stupid. I felt really bad for Evan because it's painful to see some one you love with another person. I even wished that he hooked up with Nika, or any girl just to get back at Emma (I know, I sound so immature *sigh*). However, when he finally revealed what happened to him the past 2 years, I was actually RELIEVED that after Emma, he was with Analise. I was relieved because at least he wasn't alone. He had someone who loved and cared for him even if he was at his lowest. 
 What else? Hmmm...I didn't enjoy the epilogue. I also found the switching of POV's a little confusing. Ugh, there's so many things I didn't like about this book. Let me type some things I liked instead: 
 Sara - I love her character. She's a great friend. She kept on taking care of Emma even when she was in France. Emma is so lucky to have Sara as a best friend. 
 Emma and Evan took their time before getting back together - thank God! After so many pages of Emma and Cole having sex, I really didn't want her to get intimate with Evan, at least not until Emma spill out her secrets and forgive herself. I liked that they tried to get to know each other again and started communicating about their feelings before committing in a relationship. 
 HEA - Even though I didn't like Emma here most of the time, I still think that her story deserves a happy ending. I'm glad that Emma and Evan found healing, forgiveness, strength and happiness with each other. 
 I heard Ms. Donovan is writing a novel about Jonathan (the guy Emma left with at the end of Barely Breathing). I don't like Jonathan, in fact I hated it every time Emma mentions or remembers him. So, I probably won't read his book. What I want to read though is a book about Evan. His life two years ago, while he was with Analise... while he was in Yale. We always see Evan as this sweet, caring, understanding guy... I want to see the other side of him, his life without Emma, where he acted out, when he was angry, sad, and confused. This may not happen of course, but IF the author decided to write one, it will make me REALLY happy. 
 3 out of 4 books I've read this week didn't meet my expectations, I hope the next one on my list is good. *fingers crossed*",Thu Oct 04 08:11:18 -0700 2012,Sun Jul 07 06:26:56 -0700 2013,Sun Jul 07 06:26:56 -0700 2013,Thu Jul 04 00:00:00 -0700 2013,2,5,0

 ""You know that feeling of deja vu people talk about? I live it. Every. Single. Day."" 
 This book is about a 16 year-old girl who can predict her next day through dreams. Nara Collins lives her day twice and she finds it boring. One night before she went to sleep she wished for just one ""surprising"" day... she woke up the next day regretting her wish and decided to do something to prevent her dream to happen. 
 I read this book for a reading challenge that I joined and I wasn't expecting much about it. I thought it was just another YA paranormal book, but I was wrong! I had a hard time putting it down. It sucked me in after reading a couple of chapters. I loved the plot, the writing style, the pacing, the characters... I think I liked almost everything about it, LOL! 
 Nara isn't your typical YA heroine. She's tough, independent and athletic. She's not perfect though. When she stopped dreaming her future we learned that she's misusing her gift...she started failing her classes, not performing well as a soccer goalie, and to top it off, her relationship with her best friend became shaky. Through all of that stuff, there's one guy who unexpectedly became her ally. Ethan Harris is a mystery to everyone. He has a bad reputation and keeps to himself until she met Nara. They became good friends and later developed into something more. The chemistry between this two is undeniable, they are just perfect for each other! *sigh* As they get to know each other, their secrets are revealed one by one. 
 The mystery is one of the best things in this book...*note: AVOID READING SPOILERS!* it will make you want to read more. Also, the twists in the plot and the action will keep you on the edge of your seat! There's one thing I didn't like on this book though --- Nara's friends, including Lainey. I think I'm more hurt and annoyed than Nara when Lainey believed Sophia about the whole Jared thing. The way they turned their backs on her when she wasn't performing well on their soccer games made my blood boil. And the pranks...arrgh, thank God for Ethan Harris! 
 Anyway, I am so glad that I have a copy of book 2 handy because the book ended abruptly, there were a lot of questions left unanswered. I immediately jumped to Lucid as soon as I hit the last page of The Brightest Kind of Darkness. I had to find out what happens next! If you plan on reading this, make sure you buy Lucid too. =) 
 This book is highly recommended to readers who like action romance and mystery on their YA books. =)",Wed Sep 26 10:58:15 -0700 2012,Thu Jan 10 05:27:06 -0800 2013,Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 -0800 2013,Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 -0800 2013,2,3,1

 Holy crap! It's only the 10th but I'm already stacking books on my February top reads shelf. This one is definitely one of them. 
 Rieux, France - Scarlet Benoit's grandmother have been missing for three weeks. The detectives didn't find any signs of violence and assumed that her grandmother left on her freewill. Scarlet refused to believe that her mother will leave without notifying her. Everything about it felt wrong, she knew that something happened to her grandmother. As she try to find ways to get information about Michelle Benoit's whereabouts, she encountered Wolf, a shy and handsome street fighter. When her father came back rambling things about being captured, Michelle's secrets and tattooed men, she immediately thought of Wolf and the tattoo on his arm. When she confronted Wolf, the street fighter swore that he has nothing to do about the kidnapping and promise to help her find her grandmother. 
 New Beijing, Eastern Commonwealth - Cinder was able to escape her prison cell with a cadet in tow. With the use of her new hand provided by Dr. Erland and her Lunar abilities, they were able to escape the prison unscathed. The Cadet... er Captain Carswell Thorne proved to be useful when he told Cinder about his spaceship. Though stolen, it was perfectly safe and undetectable. Together they were able to travel without being found. Cinder felt that it's time to learn about her past and her first step is to look for the woman who helped with her adoption. She needs to go to France to find Michelle Benoit. 
 Cinder and Scarlet may have different motives but they both have the same goal. Their paths will eventually cross and will be the beginning of an epic journey. 
 The book is a fairy tale retelling of The Little Red Riding Hood with heavy aspects of sci-fi. In the beginning, I wasn't very interested with Scarlet... I care more about Cinder and Kai, (thank God for the multiple POV's) but as I read along she started to grow on me. Her character isn't hard to like, she's opinionated, strong and independent. Wolf on the other hand was timid and awkward, but he's physically strong and handsome too. I also liked the addition of Captain Thorne and the return of Iko. 
 ""You're ... rather handsome, Captain Thorne."" 
 Cinder groaned. 
 ""And you, my fine lady, are the most gorgeous ship in these skies, and don't let anyone ever tell you different."" 
 The temperature drifted upward, until Cinder dropped her arms with a sigh. ""Iko, are you intentionally blushing?"" 
 The temperature dropped back down to pleasant. ""No,"" Iko said. Then, ""But am I really pretty? Even as a ship?"" 
 ""The prettiest,"" said Thorne. 
 LOL! Iko and Thorne are the constant source of humor in this book, I love them both! I also liked the romance between Scarlet and Wolf (sorry, no Kai-Cinder romance this time) 
 Wolf's expression iced over and he looked away. His tone became uneasy again. ""I know you must want nothing to do with me. I don't blame you."" Wolf scrunched up his shoulders, and met her with an expression full of regret. ""But you're the only one, Scarlet. You'll always be the only one."" 
 Her pulse fluttered. ""Wolf--"" 
 ""I know. We met less than a week ago and in that time I've done nothing but lie and cheat and betray you. I know. But if you give me a chance ... all I want is to protect you. To be near you. For as long as I'm able."" 
 Awww, these two are so cute they made Iko blush--- 
 ""Maybe next time we're on Earth you can pick up some sensors? I feel like I'm eavesdropping having the audio on all the time. It's becoming awkward."" 
 ""Awkward?"" 
 The running lights brightened, reminding Cinder of a blush. She wondered if it was intentional. 
 ""Scarlet and Wolf are saying gushy things in the galley,"" Iko said. ""Normally I like gushy things, but it's different when it's real people. I prefer the net dramas."" 
 LOL Iko! Anyway, like what I've said no Kai-Cinder romance this time. I felt bad for Kai because he's confused and unprepared for the events that occurred. He felt so betrayed for what Cinder did, even more when he found out that Dr. Erland somehow assisted with Cinder's escape. I hope everything works out between them on the next book. 
 I have to add that I liked Chapter 45! Meyer added Queen Levana's POV. Even though it was only a chapter, we get to be inside her head to learn her motivations and fears. Yep, I had to use Lana Parilla's evil queen image from Once Upon A Time because I think she's perfect for the role of Queen Levana. =D 
 Scarlet is fast-paced, engaging and action packed sci-fi romance. With how things ended, I'm expecting more action in the next book. It pains me to know that Cress wont be available until next year, however i'm excited because my favorite fairy tale character will be featured on the next book: 
 Rapunzel and Cinder in Sahara!!! I can't wait to read it!!!

 Just like any other Immortals After the Dark fan, I've been counting the days for the release of this book. So when it came out two days go, I immediately read it and pull an all-nighter to finish the book. It was entertaining. I was able to keep my eyes open and finish the book until three in the morning. However, there are some things about the new IAD book that I find disappointing. 
 One. 
 The cover. I know, do not judge the book by its cover... blah blah blah, but if you've been reading the series for quite some time, covers are important! When the cover was revealed, I was a tad disappointed. Still, I love the Lykaes and I kept my fingers cross that the content will compensate for the not-so appealing cover. Unfortunately, it didn't. 
 Two. 
 The characters. Like I said, I loved the Lykae heroes on the IAD series but Uilleam is probably an exception. Ugh, he was very stubborn and cruel. I can't stomach what he did to Chloe, he's such a jerk! Chloe's character on the other hand, was very promising. I liked her in the beginning. She's physically strong (she's a professional soccer player), independent and doesn't take shit from no one. However, when her true nature was revealed, she changed completely. From Ms. Athletic and Independent, she became Ms. Pathetic Succubus. Her situation was frustrating because other than dying, her only choice is to stick with Uilleam. She couldn't leave because everyone in the Lore wants a piece of her-being Webb's daughter and all. Also, her Succubus nature made her dependent to Will: No sex, she dies; sex with an unwilling man, she dies. I'm not kidding! She's probably the most helpless heroine in the entire IAD series. 
 Three. 
 The story. MacRieve is mediocre compared to other IAD books. It's pretty straight forward and a little predictable. It revolved mainly on Chloe -Will romance, and Will's traumatic past. I find the conflict resolution anticlimactic. The book left me dissatisfied and it felt like the book was just a filler or a novella despite it's total word count. It's definitely not your usual KC novel. Compared to it's predecessor Lothaire, it lacks action, complex story line and shocking plot twists. I think MacRieve was not intended as a stand alone novel, you'll definitely get lost if you haven't read the earlier books in the series. 
 If there's one thing I absolutely enjoyed in this book, it's definitely Nix' cameo. She's one of my favorite character in the entire IAD series and I'm truly grateful that she appeared in the first few chapters in the book. She's so funny! I love her SLUT shirt. 
 I still think that KC is one of the best paranormal romance author out there. I have no complaints about her writing, and I will continue reading her books-- fillers or not. Honestly, MacRieve isn't that bad, thus the 3-star rating. However, if you've read Lothaire before reding this, it's hard not to be disappointed. Lothaire was a really good read! Hopefully, the next book will be better than this one.",Mon Aug 27 07:24:54 -0700 2012,Sat Jul 06 10:00:34 -0700 2013,Wed Jul 03 00:00:00 -0700 2013,Tue Jul 02 00:00:00 -0700 2013,2,2,1

 I have always loved Ms. Glines' Sea Breeze series and this book is not an exception. After reading While It Lasts, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Just for Now to read more about the Sea Breeze boys and their partners! Still, after reading this book, I realized that Cage York will always be my favorite Sea Breeze guy! LOL. Don't get me wrong, Preston is really hot, it's just his lifestyle turned me off a bit. 
 Amanda have been crushing on her brother's best friend since she was 16 years old. She tried so hard to make him notice her, but he never looked at her in that way (atleast that's what she think). One night, Preston surprisingly noticed her which ended in the storage closet and Manda losing her virginity. To make the matters worst, Preston thought he dreamed the whole thing! 
 Preston have never been attracted to any woman as much as he did with Amanda. However, he couldn't make a move towards his best friend's sister, she's off limits. Also, his job isn't really something he can be proud of. Selling his body to earn for money is not his job of choice, but he needed the income to provide for his siblings. How can an innocent woman like Amanda can love a guy like him? Preston believes that he will never be good enough for Amanda Hardy. 
 Preston Drake. I already mentioned how Preston's life as a man-whore turned me off but the guy have some redeeming qualities. I like the caring brother Preston. He's such a bear when it comes to Daisy! He really just want to make his brothers' and sister's life less miserable. 
 Amanda Hardy. I admire Amanda for being so brave. Being with Preston would be difficult. Let's face it, Preston was a gigolo. He may have changed his ways, but people would still see him as that guy who slept with rich and older women for money. I want to see Amanda's mom's reaction once they tell her that she and Preston are back together! LOL. 
 Jason Stone. OMG, I am hoping that we get to read a book about Jason! He seems like a great guy, and he's been a great friend to Amanda even though he knew that she's in love with some one else. 
 While It Lasts is still my favorite Sea Breeze book, but this one is also an enjoyable read. =)",Sat Aug 25 06:49:41 -0700 2012,Fri Nov 02 07:58:02 -0700 2012,Fri Nov 02 07:58:02 -0700 2012,Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 -0700 2012,0,0,1

 3.5 stars. 
 This is the fourth and final book in the Significance series. Though it's sad to see the series end, it's still nice to know that Caleb and Maggie finally got their HEA. 
 The book starts with Maggie being bombarded with issues--- Lynne and Kyle's abilities not manifesting, Rebecca and Ralph's accident, the vision about Jen and Bish, etc. They had to cut their London visit short to attend Becky and Ralph's ""funeral service"". They found out later, through Maggie's vision, that Marcus planned Beck's accident and that it's possible that the two are still alive. Caleb and Maggie immediately took off to search for their friends. With their wedding coming up and Caleb with new responsibilities as a champion of the Jacobson's clan, there are still things that needs to be taken cared of. With Marcus still around and making trouble for their clan, things will not be easy for Caleb and Maggie. 
 Likes: Caleb's POV, finally! I also liked the happy ending, the epilogue was cute. 
 Dislikes: Okay, I have to say that I was a little disappointed with how things ended. I was really looking forward to their wedding but it didn't meet my expectations. I know the Aces wedding is different from the regular human wedding but, idk, I just didn't like that they were married with 3 other couples. Even though they were their relatives, it's just... different. It didn't feel special to me at all. Sorry! Also, I really missed the action. I was expecting them to encounter some more powerful ace or something but they only had a fight with Marcus who was no longer an ace and powerless. Although it was a little heart pumping because Maggie almost died, it wasn't as good as the epic battles in Accordance and Defiance where they used their supernatural abilities. Hmmm, what else? I think the issue about Maggie's mom (her showing up and the telephone conversation Maggie heard) just came out of nowhere and wasn't really resolved. Oh, i almost forgot, Becky seriously annoyed me in this book! I probably wont forgive her if I were Maggie...Becky called Maggie a freak when she learned about her abilities. This is after Maggie saved her and Ralph. What an ungrateful cow! 
 Well, since I'm a Significance series fan, I still read and enjoyed the book. It may not be as awesome as the other 3, but it was still a good read.",Sat Aug 18 11:35:30 -0700 2012,Fri Dec 21 21:47:17 -0800 2012,Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 -0800 2012,Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 -0800 2012,1,4,0

 """"You...love my brother?"" 
 My chest hurt at the desolation in his voice, as if he never expected to love again, couldn't really even believe in it anymore. 
 ""Yes."" 
 Opal started with Dawson lurking in Katy's room...despite being back with his siblings, the old Dawson was gone. He will never be the same again without Beth. Katy fully understand how Dawson feels specially now that she's fallen in love with Daemon. She is going along well with the two boys and even enjoys their zombie movie marathons! Dee, however, is a different story. Still mourning and bitter over Adam's death, Dee and Katy's friendship is falling apart. Worst, Dee is hanging out with Andrew and Ash also known as the ""Bitch Squad"". With her mom still communicating with Will, Beth being held by the Daedalus, and Blake showing up in school again, things are even more complicated than it was before. 
 Likes: I have one word for you: Daemon! hahahaha. Although Dawson is also a likable character, there will be only one alien I will always love, and that is Daemon, LOL. Katy is a one damn lucky hybrid! Seriously though, I liked how the relationship between Daemon and Katy developed. They became more open to each other in terms of communication before they become physically involved. I also liked the fact that Katy wasn't very annoying in this book, hehe. For some reasons, I 'm also glad that they were able to rescue Beth despite what happened to Katy in return. I'm happy for Dawson and Beth, but my heart hurts for Daemon... Oh, I also liked the change that happened with Ash and Andrew...I just hope it lasts. 
 Dislikes: Blake. When he came back I just knew that he's going to f*ck them all over again. That part was a little predictable and bleh...and what was the deal with him sleeping in Katy's bed?!? What a psycho! I hope not to see Blake again in the next book, or if ever he will re-appear, I hope it's his death scene, haha! Of course I hated the ending! Waaaaah, I need the next book now! 
 ""I love you, Katy. Always have. Always will,"" ---Daemon 
 To all Lux series fans, this book is a little frustrating but you'll like it. I promise! If you want to get a dose of alien hotness and a little bit of action, this is perfect for you! =) 
 PS. I hope that the next book will be written in Daemon's POV...",Tue Aug 14 12:51:45 -0700 2012,Thu Dec 06 00:06:10 -0800 2012,Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 -0800 2012,Tue Dec 04 00:00:00 -0800 2012,0,4,0

 I liked the story, it's simple and well explained. The characters were so real and easy to relate to. Annabel is a 17 year old with body image and self-esteem issues. Teagan on the other hand, is an 18 year old fitness trainer with daddy issues. When they first met in a gym where Teagan is working, there was an instant attraction between them. However, Annabel's insecurities made her believe that there is no way Teagan will like a girl like her. I liked the relationship between the two, I loved the banters and their work outs. It reminds me of my own attempts to lose weight! =D This is the ""relatable"" part. I'm actually the same height with Annabel and even though I never reached her weight (which is 168 lbs, my heaviest weight was 135 lbs), my BMI is still overweight. I understand her frustrations and fear of failing. It takes a lot of commitment and self control to reach your goal in loosing weight. Annabel is lucky to have Teagan to push her to her limits and encourage her to lose weight. I did it on my own and it was so freaking hard! I did met my goal like Annabel did, of course her's was better because she received a bonus--- Teagan! 
 I have to add that I loved Teagan's loyalty and sense of responsibility to his family. Even though he's trying too hard to make up for his dad's absence, I still think that Teagan is a good kid. Speaking of families, I hate Annabel's mom! I wish she tried harder to get to know her daughter and understand what she's going through. Parents are not perfect, but they should at least try right? I love Teagan's Mom and brother though. 
 I recommend this book to those who are struggling with their body image and self-worth. This is a perfect weight loss success story, it can motivate you and push you to try harder to meet your goals. The love story is pretty good too! =)",Sun Aug 12 14:46:05 -0700 2012,Tue Mar 26 23:29:38 -0700 2013,Mon Mar 25 00:00:00 -0700 2013,Sat Mar 23 00:00:00 -0700 2013,0,0,1

 Accordance begins with Caleb and Maggie in California with their chaperons (Bish and Kyle). Now that the couple have ascended, Maggie is now a Seer but Caleb's ability haven't manifested at all. With Kyle's constant attempt to make Maggie like him, Bish being overprotective and her new found role as a Visionary, Maggie can no longer handle the pressure on her own. Together with Caleb and the rest of the Jacobson's, they will find ways to get used to her abilities and face the trials ahead. 
 Likes: Caleb! He's so sweet, caring and selfless. Even though he thought that his ability will not manifest, he never got jealous over Maggie's abilities and Visionary role. I was also relieved that they finally shared the Aces' secret to Bish. Atleast now he'll stop being a paranoid and overprotective of Maggie. I'm also glad that Maggie finally got rid of Kyle, hahaha. I loved the fight scene on the last chapters when we finally realized what ability Caleb has. His power reminds me of Peter Petrelli of the TV Show Heroes, hehe, he borrows the supernatural abilities of people around him. It's pretty cool! 
 Dislikes: It annoys me everytime Kyle tries to get Maggie's attention, why can't he just let go? His efforts were useless because Caleb and Maggie's soul chose each other, there's no way he can get Maggie away from Caleb. I can't tell you how thankful I am when he finally found his significant! haha. I was also disappointed about the Jenna - Bish situation. 
 ""Don't touch me,"" she begged, ""I have a daughter and I have to think of her. Please, don't touch me."" 
 Poor Bish and Jenna. Hmmm, I think I maybe be the only one who doesn't approve of Maggie and Caleb's engagement. I think it's too early for them to get married! I mean, sure we already know that they are going to be together anyway, but why rush it? Maggie isn't even 18 yet... 
 Anyway, this was a great sequel! I'm going to re-read the next one...",Wed Aug 01 10:06:15 -0700 2012,Sat Dec 08 01:56:28 -0800 2012,Wed Aug 01 00:00:00 -0700 2012,Wed Aug 01 00:00:00 -0700 2012,2,0,1

 I'm re-reading the series while waiting for the 4th and final book...INDEPENDENCE! I'm addicted to this series and I can't wait to read the last book! 
 Maggie is a really smart seventeen year old who is graduating a year early from high school but she's having her worst year. Her mom left, her adopted brother is in New York and she is stuck with her depressed Dad. Also, her boyfriend dumped her 3 days after her mom left. She was forced to work so that she can support herself since her father was sacked from his job. Boyfriend-less and no plans for college, she attended her graduation day with no expectations. Her long time friend Kyle asked her to have a date with him that night, since she's been rejecting his invitations for the entire year after her break up with her long time boyfriend, she finally agreed. Night came and she found herself saving a guy from being trampled by a truck, a guy who will change her life. Caleb was saved by the girl he was ogling at the stop light, she was beautiful and charming, funny too. Apparently she was his cousin's (Kyle) date. Who would've thought that the girl he just met will be her significant for the rest of his life? 
 Caleb belongs to a non-human family. They are called Aces because they have supernatural abilities. The manner of marriage is made through ""imprints"" the imprint chooses their soul mates. However, there was no imprint that occurred for the past 20 years, thus, many Aces are single and powerless (because they only get their supernatural abilities in the process called ascending AFTER they imprinted). This is the reason why Maggie and Caleb's imprinting created a buzz within the Ace community---it brought hope to others and envy to enemies. Also, the fact that Maggie is a human and only 17 years old made things more complicated. Usually imprints occur for Aces that are on their early twenties which is of marrying age in the Ace community. 
 I liked pretty much everything in this book! LOL. Like what I've said, I'm addicted! I loved the story, the characters as well as the writing style. Some people might hate the ""insta-love"" between Maggie and Caleb, but I actually loved it. Maggie and Caleb are perfect for each other, nuff said. Caleb was an amazing significant, he's just so sweet and caring. Maggie is not bad either, instead of giving up when she was held in captivity by the Watsons clan, she stayed strong and managed to escape. Plus, Maggie's ability is pretty awesome! 
 Did I say how addictive this book was? If you're a fan of paranormal romances you have to read this! And make sure you have the 2nd and 3rd book available because you'll want to read the next book as soon as you finished the first one, lol!

 The story begins with Landon Carter reminiscing his senior year in Beaufort High. The year where Landon, a politician son fell for Jamie Sullivan, a pastor's daughter. Destiny brought these two different personalities together which changed their lives and the people around them forever. 
 Likes: Everything! When I first read this book, I was completely awed by how good it was written considering the fact that it was in a male's POV. The writing was simple and poignant. What I really liked about the story is how pure and innocent the love is between the main characters. Sure they were young, but what they had was real. The characters are also likable. Landon was flawed, he's insecure, and probably not the brightest kid in school but deep inside he's a good guy. Jamie was the good girl but her goodness seems to repel people. In other words, she's a social outcast. I love the character development. We saw how Jamie changed Landon and how his experience made him a better person. 
 Dislikes: I couldn't think of anything...

I missed these characters and their crazy (so unbelievably crazy!) antics. I had an incredible time reading this. It was so much fun being swept up in that whirlwind, I can't wait for the next book. Especially since I have a new couple I love and ship. 
 That being said, it has not improved skill-wise. Like the book before SJM had a ton of ideas and just put them all in, whether they make sense, fit the natural progression of the story or add to the ebb and flow a book should have. She just stacks one thing on top of the other,throws in every trope she knows, people switch sides every other chapter, it's crazy. Like I said, entertainingly crazy, but still. It's the book equivalent to an over-the-top soap opera and I really wish she would leave a little bit of it on the cutting room floor. I mean, (view spoiler)[the end image of Feyre and Rhys flying over Velaris would be so beautiful but of course she's wearing lingerie. Did they forget that? Did Sarah? Come on! (hide spoiler)] 
 This is also the book where SJM noticed that people want more LGBT representation and proceeds by randomly introducing LGBT people. I had the impression that she literally put all the sexualitys and names in hats, drew some and decided to just go with whatever fate told her. I'm also pretty sure that a lot of shippers are mad about one choice she made here... 
 Until neyt year,fellow readers, when the crazy continues. My prediction: Feyre gets pregnant by the end of it, (view spoiler)[Elain is caught in a love square, Mor and the cursed princess get it on, hopefully Nesta and Cassian make some progress (I'm so invested, there are no words. how did this happen to me?)

 There's such an amount of suspense, believable romance, humour (where is that humour coming from? It's a very serious storyline and yet I laughed 'til I cried so many times), surprises and tragedy in this book, it's insane. All brought to you wrapped in beautiful prose. 
 I can find not a single flaw apart from the fact that the ending is abrupt and the promised short stories are still not out.... So basically, my only problem is that it was over much too soon.
