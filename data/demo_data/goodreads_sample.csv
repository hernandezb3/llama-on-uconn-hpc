 So here's what I like about My Soul to Take 
 It is a quick read and straightforward enough 
 I like the concept and the world it's trying to depict. I haven't really read/watch much about banshees. Except from Lydia in Teen Wolf. 
 And I liked how it is written. 
 The sad thing is I don't think I'm going to read more of Kaylee, Nash and Tod anytime soon. Aside from the 'brewing' LOVE TRIANGLE (guys please correct me if I'm wrong, I so hope I am) it did not excite me at all to go and grab the next book. But I know I'm still going to. (I feel like if I've read this 4 years earlier I would've loved it) 
 I really don't appreciate insta-love. 
 It was a good read but it feels flat. Like it didn't evoke emotions from me, much more curiousity. 
 Did it made me nervous about these senseless deaths? No. 
 Am I curious about Tod? Not so much 
 Do I want to know more about the Netherworld? Yes. But I'm in no hurry. So yeah feel free to build it up more. 
 Am I gonna read the next book? Yes. 
 Do I know when? No. 
 Will I recommend it? YES! This book might not left me in awe. But it doesn't mean it's bad.",Wed Jan 16 20:34:44 -0800 2013,Sun Mar 05 23:33:52 -0800 2017,Tue Mar 07 00:00:00 -0800 2017,Tue Feb 28 00:00:00 -0800 2017,1,0

 About ten different plot lines compiled into one book. 
 The Long Version: 
 Somehow it worked. 
 This book took me about a month to read. Normally if a if I haven't finished reading a book within a month, that means I won't finish it. Ever. 
 Now, if I'm being completely honest I forget most of what happened in the Crooked Kingdom. But that's due to how long it took me to read it, not how compelling the book was/wasn't. 
 There are more references to the Grisha trilogy in this Crooked Kingdom than in Six of Crows so I found myself asking people online who/what they were referring to. It doesn't take away from the plot, but you can tell that these are references from the other series. This is similar in any spin off series (from TMI to TID or the Mistborn OT to the later Mistborn books, all have references to previous events). 
 I'm going to keep the review short to avoid spoilers: I liked this book. There were less melodramatic arguments. Bardugo has really grown as an author from the first Grisha book to this one. I love the diversity in this series (I really cannot wait until the day diversity in YA becomes so common practice that I no longer have to celebrate when it's actually included in a book). 
 But there were a lot of plot lines. Almost too many. It was like if someone decided to put the plots of all of the Ocean's *insert number here* movies into one film and call it a day. Translation: it was a lot for one book, not a lot for several books. But since I like elaborate plots and heist and thievery and underdogs and the Dregs it was worth it. 
 This book is more of a 4.5/5 stars for me. Partially because of having too many plots, partially because of my mixed feelings on the ending (which happens at the ending of EVERY series I read), partially because it took me too long to read so I forget half of what happened, partially because it was entertaining as hell. 
 As I said in my Six of Crows review: if you hated the Grisha trilogy, give Six of Crows and (subsequently) Crooked Kingdom a shot. If you loved the Grisha books then you have no excuse for not wanting to read Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom. 
 Overall it was an enjoyable read that had too many plot lines and less character backstories, but more character development than the previous book.

 ""People change even under the best circumstances. And when you pull them back from death's door, well, that's no small thing."" 
 I went into this book with low expectations and I'm not entirely sure why that is. I'm not usually a fan of stories involving aliens and once again, I don't really understand why because I find the idea of aliens and their most likely existence to be extremely fascinating. As it turns out though, I really thoroughly enjoyed this story! It wasn't nearly as cheesy as I was expecting and I found that it actually felt pretty realistic. 
 Karen McQuestion has done a great job in creating a story involving an alien species that feels very realistic and could possibly happen if it hasn't already. The writing style was very fast paced and there was not one moment where the story felt as if it were dragging on. 
 For the most part, this story is told from the perspective of Emma, a young teenager who is trying to cope with her very sick, and unfortunately, dying boyfriend Lucas. What I found particularly interesting and unique though, was that the opening chapter was actually told from the point of view of Lucas' dog Mack. This was the only chapter told from this point of view, but as the story progresses there are a few chapters scattered throughout the novel that are told from another point of view (no spoilers, I promise!). These chapters are short and sweet and straight to the point. 
 ""This is a very confusing planet. People believe things that aren't true about other people just because of how they look and what kind of vehicle they drive. Why can you not wait and see who they are inside before you make a decision?"" 
 I found that Emma as a character was a bit bland and was unfortunately shadowed by some of the other characters. There wasn't much character development on her part. I really wish Lucas' brother Eric was included more in the story, in fact I wish he could have been a part of the main storyline/adventure that takes place during a large chunk of this book. Eventually, we meet another character who is not from our planet Earth. The circumstances in which he is introduced to the reader was one of the things that I found the most unique and interesting. It probably isn't the first time this approach has been taken in an alien-based story, but I found it to be believable and realistic. For lack of an English name, Eric decides to name this alien Scout based on his profession on his home planet. Out of every character within this story, Scout goes through the most character development. In my opinion, he was the best character throughout the entire novel. 
 One thing I was worried about when going into this story was the potential for unanswered questions. This could be another reason why I have a hard time getting into the sci-fi genre, but I hate feeling confused while reading a story. Most of the time, I tend to want answers. It seemed as though every time I questioned anything in this book or anytime I thought I had found a flaw, my question was answered. There were no loose ends and everything tied in well. 
 Overall, this was a great young adult novel to mix up the general contemporaries I usually read. It was fun to read something a little more paranormal even though it did end up feeling quite realistic and possible. This story had a great adventure/road trip element to it and it was definitely a fun, fast-paced and entertaining read from start to finish. 
 ""The sunset,"" I answered. ""It's gorgeous."" It always was. A dusky, blue backdrop interrupted by slashes of light and color. From night to night it was never quite the same, but somehow it was always familiar and beautiful. And it happened every single night. If you gave it some thought, you'd wonder why all of society didn't shut down to watch this. If we were smart, we'd be turning off our electronics, leaving our homes, and settling down on our porches and driveways just to take it in. Each night a different miracle in the sky. But no, most of us never even bothered to look out the window. While this gorgeous light show went on outside, we did the dishes and texted and argued and watched TV. We let out all of those tedious, mundane, everyday things get in the way. ""Tonight it's really pretty.""

 Set shortly after The Raven Boys, the students of Aglionby Academy are still looking for the Welsh king. While this story is told from multiple POVs, its main focus is on Ronan Lynch, a dream thief. 
 ""He was brother to a liar and brother to an angel, son of a dream and son of a dreamer."" 
 I was pretty nervous to read this book considering how much I loved the first one.But his was even better than the first. At the end of book one we discovered that Chainsaw, Ronan's raven, came from his dreams and this book starts off right after that. 
 By far, the best thing about this series are the characters. I love each character for different reasons, but it's impossible for me to pick a favorite. I worry for Adam, he struggles with so much. My love for Noah has grown even more, though I wish he would have come out more. Blue got even more interesting and awesome in this one. Gansey will always have a special place in my heart, seriously he's amazing. We also got to learn so much about Ronan here and my heart just ached for him and his loneliness. Chainsaw is all kinds of awesome. 
 Adam's response was buried in the sound of the second-story door falling open. Noah slouched in. In a wounded tone, he said, ""He threw me out the window!"" 
 Ronan's voice sang out from behind his closed door: ""You're already dead!"" 
 There's also a new character who's quickly introduced in his own chapters known as The Gray Man. He definitely added to both the mystery and the character dynamics. I didn't really know what his deal was. Was he evil? A sociopath? Or just immoral? Whatever he is, all I can say is that I really liked him. 
 Like all of Stiefvater's books, The Dream Thieves is carefully planned, extremely detailed and elegantly written. Stiefvater's writing is practically flawless, her words are vibrant, rich, and heartbreaking. 
 This is more of a character driven book than an action-packed book, but that's fine since the characters are so wonderful and well-rounded. The setting is magical and makes it the perfect atmosphere for the story to unfold. And the story itself is original. This is definitely a one of a kind. 
 ""While I'm gone,"" Gansey said, pausing, ""dream me the world. Something new for every night.""

 The plot is extremely original within the vampires living among humans genre. The Belladonna Agency is a secretive division of the FBI tasked with hunting down rogue vampires, some of which have been created by another FBI division. 
 Some of the FBI agents in this novel were turned into vampires against their will and are now working for the agency, while four women with varied backgrounds have also been recruited. The character development was nicely done, with the Hero being a vampire FBI agent and the heroine a reformed ex gang member. 
 While reading Turned I would be very involved in the story, then I would completely lose interest because an extremely drawn out sex scene would take place. The sex would be described in the heroine's POV, then repeated in the Hero's POV and then recapped. It was so redundant and unnecessary. 
 I think that readers that love PNR would enjoy Turned; if you are strictly reading it for the romance you may wish to skip this one.

However, when going to post his reply at the nearest post box he just keeps going, until he decides to walk the 600+ miles to actually talk to the person in question in person. 
 I really liked this book. I think it portrayed the fragility of humans, and our relationships, in a very real and honest manner. The real, and metaphorical, journey that Harold goes on is incredibly poignant. I felt his highs and, equally, felt his lows, as he traipsed through the English countryside, and cities, just as I felt those of Maureen, the wife who was left at home (who had her own POV chapters.) 
 One of my issues with this book was how seemingly open everyone that Harold encountered was. I appreciate how it shows that everyone has their own issues, and talking to a stranger can be helpful in its own right, but I couldn't believe that so many people would spew out all of their secrets to a man who was walking up the country. 
 A lot of the book is also centred looking back on your life, and the actions you took. Especially ones that you regret. As a younger person, it made me stop and think of my actions. If I make it to sixty-five years old, how will I look back on the decisions I'm making today? How am I dealing with situations that aren't always in my control? I was actually passed on this book by my eighty year old Grandfather, and it made me wonder how he interrupted the words, and how he looks back on his own life.

Unfortunately no mystery at all for me because I happened to read the back of the book, but as my husband pointed out, they probably summarize the major plot points there for parents wondering what their kid is about to read. Kids that age (8-12) probably don't care that much about spoilers either. 
 Still, it's a fun read. It's the story of recently orphaned boy who goes to live with his uncle in a big mysterious mansion. Magic and adventure ensue. There are some jokes in there that are clearly for the adults reading this to their kids, much like the old cartoons had, and the banter between the boy's uncle and the neighbor lady is pretty cute. The illustrations by Edward Gorey are wonderful, too. 
 I'm only giving 3 stars, however, because it feels a bit dated. For example, repeated references to the protagonist's weight seemed unnecessary, since it had nothing to do with the story. Maybe calling him ""fatty"" was the running joke for the eight-year-old readers? Not sure something like that would fly these days unless it were a greater focus in the book.
